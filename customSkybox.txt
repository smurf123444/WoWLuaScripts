Certainly! Let's dive into more detail on the creation of a custom skybox based on the provided tutorial:

### 6. Creation of Custom Skybox:

#### a. Obtain Client Coordinates:

   - In a tool like Noggit, find the client coordinates of the desired location. For example, X=20540, Y=11690, Z=1600.

#### b. Insert a New Row in LightParams.dbc:

   - Open LightParams.dbc and add a new row (e.g., ID 954). This row will represent the settings for your custom skybox.

#### c. Add a New Row in Light.dbc:

   - Calculate the client-side coordinates for your skybox (multiply by 36).
   - Determine inner and outer radius values (multiply by 36).
   - Insert a new row in Light.dbc with the calculated values and reference the ID from LightParams.dbc (954 in this case).

   Example:
   ```
   ID | Map ID | X | Z | Y | Inner Radius | Outer Radius | LightParams IDs...
   954 | MapID | X*36 | Z*36 | Y*36 | 1388*36 | 1666*36 | 954 | ... | ...
   ```

#### d. Use WDBX Editor for LightIntBand.dbc:

   - Open LightIntBand.dbc in WDBX Editor.
   - Add 18 new lines starting from (954 * 18 â€“ 17) to (954 * 18).
   - Fill in time values for each phase (e.g., morning, day, night).
   - Use the Color function in WDBX Editor to generate BGR codes for each phase.
   - Repeat this process for all phases and rows.

   Example:
   ```
   ID | Phases | Time (morning) | BGR Codes (morning) | Time (day) | BGR Codes (day) | Time (night) | BGR Codes (night)...
   954*18-17 | 3 | 960 | BGR1 | 2280 | BGR2 | ... | ...
   ```

#### e. Edit LightFloatBand.dbc:

   - Open LightFloatBand.dbc.
   - Insert 6 new rows corresponding to the ID from LightParams.dbc (954 in this case).
   - Set fog distance, fog density, brightness, and other values for each phase.

   Example:
   ```
   Row ID | Phases | Time (morning) | Fog Distance | Fog Density | Brightness | Cloud Density...
   954*6-5 | 3 | 960 | 9000 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 0.6 | ... | ...
   ```

#### f. Optional: LightSkyBox.dbc for Skybox Models:

   - If you want to add a custom skybox model, open LightSkyBox.dbc.
   - Insert a row with a unique ID and specify the path to the model.
   - Set properties like transparency based on the requirement.

   Example:
   ```
   ID | Model Path | Flags...
   SkyboxID | Environments/Stars/[MODEL].mdx | 2...
   ```

#### g. Finalization:

   - Save all the edited Dbc files.
   - Place the files, along with textures (blps) and models (m2s), into the game patch.

#### h. Verify In-Game:

   - Launch the game and go to the specified location (Hyjal in this example).
   - Verify that the custom skybox is working as intended.

#### i. Troubleshooting and Discussion:

   - If any issues arise, refer to the tutorial for troubleshooting tips.
   - Engage with the community for discussions or assistance.

This detailed breakdown should guide you through the process of creating a custom skybox in WoW [3.3.5.]. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions!
