Forest Boss #3 

Phase 1: Eerie Forest

Players venture into a shadowed grove, encountering the Forest Warden corrupted by dark magic.
The boss periodically summons cursed forest creatures to assist in battle.
Players must defeat the cursed creatures while avoiding the boss's dark spells and curses.

Phase 2: Veil of Shadows

As the boss's health decreases, the grove becomes engulfed in a thick veil of shadows, obscuring vision and impairing movement.
Players periodically become marked with the "Shadowed" debuff, reducing their damage and healing output.
Players must navigate through the shadows, dispelling the debuff and finding pockets of light to restore their effectiveness.

Phase 3: Tainted Ground

At a certain health threshold, the boss corrupts the ground, causing tainted patches to spawn throughout the area.
Standing on the tainted ground inflicts players with a stacking damage-over-time effect.
Players must constantly move to avoid the tainted patches while continuing to engage the boss.

Phase 4: Dark Reflections

Once the boss's corruption reaches its peak, it splits into shadowy clones that mirror its abilities.
The boss and its clones periodically switch positions, confusing players and making it challenging to target the real boss.
Players must quickly identify and focus on the actual boss while avoiding the clones' deceptive attacks.

Phase 5: Shadows' Embrace

In the final phase, the boss draws upon the power of darkness, enveloping the grove in an impenetrable shadow aura.
Players' vision is severely limited, and the boss gains increased damage and attack speed.
Players must rely on sound cues and positional awareness to evade the boss's devastating attacks and bring it down.

Note that the order of these phases can vary depending on the raid's strategy or modifications made by the raid group. Additionally, the encounter may have additional mechanics or variations based on the raid's difficulty level.
