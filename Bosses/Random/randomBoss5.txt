2. If the current phase is 4 (Transform & Movement Phase):
   - The boss moves to a specific location (-9113, 400, 92).
   - The player follows the boss for 5 yards.
   - A puff of smoke effect is spawned and then despawned after 5 seconds.

   - If solved, a spell is cast on the player to initiate the next phase.
   - If not solved, mechanics or penalties can be applied.
   - Additional puzzle phase mechanics can be added.
5. If the current phase is 9 and a sound has not been played yet, a sound is played.
