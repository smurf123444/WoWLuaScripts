Jungle Boss #3:

1. The code checks the boss's health and determines the current phase based on the health percentage.
2. If the current phase is 2 (Summon Adds Phase):
   - The boss summons a wave of smaller adds to join the fight.
   - Each add has its own set of abilities and mechanics, posing a threat to players.
   - Players must prioritize and manage the adds while dealing with boss mechanics.
3. If the current phase is 4 (Berserk Phase):
   - The boss enters a berserk state, increasing its damage and attack speed significantly.
   - Players need to quickly defeat the boss before it overwhelms the raid.
4. If the current phase is 6 (Roots Trap Phase):
   - Roots spawn randomly around the room, creating obstacles for players.
   - Players caught in the roots are immobilized and need assistance from others to break free.
   - Breaking the roots requires dealing damage or using specific abilities.
5. If the current phase is 8 (Shadow Illusion Phase):
   - The boss creates multiple shadow illusions that mirror its abilities and mechanics.
   - Players need to identify the real boss among the illusions to effectively deal damage.
6. The current phase is announced with a yell and sound effect if it hasn't been announced before.
7. The boss casts the spell associated with the current phase on its target.

Remember that these are just examples, and you can customize and expand upon them based on your specific boss design and encounter requirements.
