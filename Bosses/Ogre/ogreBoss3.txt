- The goal is to deal damage to Flame Leviathan's health while dealing with various adds and mechanics.
- Players can use demolisher/siege vehicle abilities to damage the boss and control the encounter.

Phase 2: Tower Defense Phase
- Once Flame Leviathan's health reaches a certain threshold, towers located around the area become active.
- Players must prioritize and destroy these towers to disable their effects.
- Each tower has a different ability or effect that can hinder the players' progress if not dealt with.

Phase 3: Demolisher/Siege Vehicle Detonation
- At the end of the Tower Defense Phase, all remaining active demolishers and siege vehicles explode.
- The explosion deals damage to nearby players and destroys the remaining towers.
- Players need to move away from the vehicles to avoid the explosion and its aftermath.

Phase 4: Mounted Assault

- Players dismount from their vehicles and engage the boss directly.
