Certainly! Here's another example of phases and events for a jungle boss in version 3.3.5a:

Forest Boss 4:

Phase 1: Awakening of the Ancients

Players enter a secluded grove where an ancient treant has awakened, seeking to defend its territory.
The boss periodically summons smaller treant minions to aid in battle.
Players must defeat the treant minions while avoiding the boss's powerful nature-based attacks.

Phase 2: Entangling Roots

As the boss's health decreases, it unleashes its mastery over nature, causing the ground to sprout entangling roots.
The roots periodically spawn throughout the area, immobilizing players and dealing damage over time.
Players must break free from the roots and find safe zones to avoid further entanglement.

Phase 3: Barkskin Defense

At a certain health threshold, the boss activates its defensive ability, encasing itself in thick barkskin.
While in barkskin form, the boss takes reduced damage from all sources.
Players must locate and activate ancient stone shrines scattered around the area to weaken the barkskin's durability.

Phase 4: Feral Rampage

Once the barkskin is weakened, the boss enters a feral rampage, increasing its movement speed and attack power.
The boss charges at random players, dealing high damage and knocking them back.
Players must quickly react to the boss's charges, avoiding being trampled and finding opportunities to counterattack.

Phase 5: Nature's Wrath

In the final phase, the boss channels the raw power of nature, causing the grove itself to rise against the players.
The environment becomes hostile, with falling trees, cascading rocks, and sudden bursts of overgrowth.
Players must navigate the chaotic landscape, adapting to the ever-changing hazards while continuing to engage the boss.
